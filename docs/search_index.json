The participants get an overview of the reproducible data analysis workflow in modern multi-omics, with a focus on recent examples from published microbiome studies. After the course you will know how to approach new tasks in biomedical data analysis by utilizing available documentation and R tools. The teaching will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The openly licensed teaching material will be available online during and after the course, following national recommendations on open education. The training material walks you through the standard steps of biomedical data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, reproducible reporting, and best practices in open science. We will teach generic data analytical skills that are applicable to common data analysis tasks encountered in modern omics research. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the student’s learning speed. 1.2 Schedule and organizers The course will be organized in a live format (Flyer) Venue University of Oulu. June 20-23, 2022. Schedule Contact teaching daily between 9am – 5pm, including lectures, demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and breaks. A detailed schedule is available at the course website: (https://microbiome.github.io/course_2022_oulu). Teachers and organizers Leo Lahti is the main teacher and Associate Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku, with specialization on biomedical data analysis. Course assistants are Tuomas Borman (University of Turku) is one of the main developers of the open training material covered by the course and Jenni Hekkala, a PhD researcher at the University of Oulu, in the group of the course coordinator Docent Justus Reunanen. The course is jointly organized by Health and Biosciences Doctoral Programme University of Oulu Graduate School Cancer &amp; Translational Medicine Research Unit, University of Oulu Department of Computing, University of Turku, Finland Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) supports the course with cloud computing services 1.3 How to apply Target audience The course is primarily designed for advanced MSc and PhD students, Postdocs, and biomedical researchers who wish to learn and develop new skills in scientific programming and biomedical data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. The course has limited capacity of max 20 participants, and priority will given for local students from Oulu. Expected background Some earlier experience with R or another programming language is recommended. However, this can be compensated by familiarizing with the course material in advance, if necessary. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the student’s learning speed. Application Send a brief motivation letter to Jenni Hekkala first.last@oulu.fi Applications sent before May 20 will be given priority Course fee The course fee covers contact teaching and teaching material. 285 euros with registration by May 20, 2022 350 euros with registration after May 20, 2022 Local students are exempted from the fee Accommodation Accommodation and travel costs are not included in the registration fee.

Instructions to access the environment will be sent to the registered participants. Setting up the system on your own computer is not required for the course but it can be useful for later use. The required software: R (version &gt;4.1.0) RStudio; choose “Rstudio Desktop” to download the latest version. Optional but preferred. For further details, check the Rstudio home page. Install and load the required R packages (see Section 3.3) After a successful installation you can start with the case study examples in this training material 3.2 Support and resources Online support on installation and other matters, join us at Gitter Additional reading and online material are listed in Section 5. You can run the workflows by simply copy-pasting the examples. For further, advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the online book, and apply these techniques to your own data. 3.3 Installing and loading the required R packages This section shows how to install and load all required packages into the R session.
