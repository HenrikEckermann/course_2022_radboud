The required software: R (version &gt;4.1.0) RStudio; choose “Rstudio Desktop” to download the latest version. Optional but preferred. For further details, check the Rstudio home page. Install and load the required R packages (see Section 3.3) After a successful installation you can start with the case study examples in this training material 3.2 Support and resources Online support on installation and other matters, join us at Gitter Additional reading and online material are listed in Section 5. You can run the workflows by simply copy-pasting the examples. For further, advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the online book, and apply these techniques to your own data. 3.3 Installing and loading the required R packages This section shows how to install and load all required packages into the R session. Only uninstalled packages are installed. # List of packages that we need from cran and bioc cran_pkg &lt;- c(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ecodist&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;gridExtra&quot;, &quot;kableExtra&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;scales&quot;, &quot;vegan&quot;, &quot;matrixStats&quot;) bioc_pkg &lt;- c(&quot;yulab.utils&quot;,&quot;ggtree&quot;,&quot;ANCOMBC&quot;, &quot;ape&quot;, &quot;DESeq2&quot;, &quot;DirichletMultinomial&quot;, &quot;mia&quot;, &quot;miaViz&quot;) # Get those packages that are already installed cran_pkg_already_installed &lt;- cran_pkg[ cran_pkg %in% installed.packages() ] bioc_pkg_already_installed &lt;- bioc_pkg[ bioc_pkg %in% installed.packages() ] # Get those packages that need to be installed cran_pkg_to_be_installed &lt;- setdiff(cran_pkg, cran_pkg_already_installed) bioc_pkg_to_be_installed &lt;- setdiff(bioc_pkg, bioc_pkg_already_installed) # Reorders bioc packages, so that mia and miaViz are first bioc_pkg &lt;- c(bioc_pkg[ bioc_pkg %in% c(&quot;mia&quot;, &quot;miaViz&quot;) ], bioc_pkg[ !bioc_pkg %in% c(&quot;mia&quot;, &quot;miaViz&quot;) ] ) # Combine to one vector packages &lt;- c(bioc_pkg, cran_pkg) packages_to_install &lt;- c( bioc_pkg_to_be_installed, cran_pkg_to_be_installed ) # If there are packages that need to be installed, install them if( length(packages_to_install) ) { install.packages(packages_to_install) } Now all required packages are installed, so let’s load them into the session.
