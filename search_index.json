June 20-23, 2022. Organized together with University of Turku, Finland. Figure source: Moreno-Indias et al. (2021) Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in Human Microbiome Studies: Contemporary Challenges and Solutions. Frontiers in Microbiology 12:11. 1.1 Introduction This course is based on data science with R, a popular open source environment for scientific data analysis. It provides general capabilities for the analysis, integration, and visualization of multi-omic data from biomedical studies. The course is based on miaverse (mia = MIcrobiome Analysis), an R/Bioconductor framework for microbiome data science. The data science framework consists of the following elements: efficient multi-omic data container a package ecosystem, providing algorithmic data analysis methods demonstration data sets open documentation The framework is explained in a greater depth in the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis. The book is currently a development version. 1.2 Learning goals The course aims to provide the basic understanding and skills for biomedical data analysis with R and Bioconductor. The course provides an overview of reproducible data analysis and reporting workflow in multi-omic studies, with recent example data sets published microbiome studies. The participants become familiar with standard concepts and methods in multi-omic data analysis, in particular in human microbiome research. This includes better understanding of the specific statistical challenges, practical hands-on experience with the commonly used methods, and reproducible research with R. After the course you will know how to approach new tasks in microbiome data science by utilizing available documentation and R tools. Target audience Advanced MSc and PhD students, Postdocs, and biomedical researchers who wish to develop their skills in scientific programming and biomedical data analysis. 1.3 Schedule The course takes place daily between 9am – 5pm, including coffee and lunch breaks. The course will be organized in a live format but the material will be openly available online during and after the course. A priority will given for local students from Oulu. Participants from other higher education institutions are welcome to apply. The mornings will start with lectures, and afternoons are mainly dedicated to hands-on sessions that consist of practical tasks and example data from recent research literature. Students will solve the exercises based on available online examples and resources that are pointed out in the study material. There is often more than one way to solve a given task, and the teachers will be available for assistance. Monday: Orientation Best practices in reproducible reporting and open science Hands-on: Introduction to R Tuesday: Key concepts and challenges in biomedical data analysis Hands-on: Biomedical data exploration Wednesday: Key concepts in biomedical data visualization Hands-on: Biomedical data visualization Thursday: Advanced topics: common machine learning techniques Hands-on: multi-omic data integration and reproducible workflows Friday: Student presentations Summary &amp; Conclusions 1.4 Material The teaching material follows open online documentation created by the course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). We will teach generic data analytical skills that are applicable to common data analysis tasks encountered in modern omics research. The training material walks through example workflows that go through standard steps of biomedical data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, reproducible reporting, and best practices in open science. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the student’s learning speed. You can run the workflow by simply copy-pasting the examples. For further, advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the OMA book, or try to apply the techniques to your own data. We expect that the students will install the necessary software in advance. Online support will be available.
