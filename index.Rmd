# Overview

## Contents and learning goals

This course will teach the **basics of biomedical data analysis with
R/Bioconductor**, a popular open source environment for scientific
data analysis. The participants get an overview of the reproducible
data analysis workflow in modern multi-omics, with a focus on recent
examples from published microbiome studies. After the course you will
know how to approach new tasks in biomedical data analysis by
utilizing available documentation and R tools.

The teaching will follow open online documentation created by the
course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome
Analysis (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The openly licensed
teaching material will be available online during and after the
course, following national recommendations on open education.

The training material walks you through the standard steps of
biomedical data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis,
visualization, reproducible reporting, and best practices in open
science.  We will teach generic data analytical skills that are
applicable to common data analysis tasks encountered in modern omics
research. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the
student's learning speed.


## Schedule and organizers

The course will be organized in a live format.

**Venue** University of Oulu. June 20-23, 2022.

**Schedule** Contact teaching daily between 9am â€“ 5pm, including
  lectures, demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and breaks. A 
  detailed schedule is available at the course website:
  (https://microbiome.github.io/course_2022_oulu).

**Teachers and organizers**

[Leo Lahti](https://datascience.utu.fi) is the main teacher and
Associate Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku, with
specialization on biomedical data analysis.

Course assistant _Tuomas Borman_ (University of Turku) is one of the main developers of the
open training material covered by the course.

Course coordinator _Jenni Hekkala_ is PhD researcher at the University of Oulu.

The course is jointly organized by

- Health and Biosciences Doctoral Programme, University of Oulu Graduate School
- Department of Computing, University of Turku, Finland
- Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) supports the course with cloud
  computing services


## How to apply

**Target audience**

The course is primarily designed for advanced MSc and PhD students,
Postdocs, and biomedical researchers who wish to learn and develop new skills in
scientific programming and biomedical data analysis. Academic students
and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to
apply. The course has limited capacity of max 20 participants, and
priority will given for local students from Oulu.

**Expected background** Some earlier experience with R or another
  programming language is recommended. However, this can be
  compensated by familiarizing with the course material in advance, if
  necessary. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the
  student's learning speed.

**Application**

  * Send a brief motivation letter to Jenni Hekkala <first.last@oulu.fi>
  * Applications sent before May 20 will be given priority


**Course fee**

The course fee covers contact teaching and teaching material.

  * 285 euros with registration by May 20, 2022
  * 350 euros with registration after May 20, 2022
  * Local students are exempted from the fee


**Accommodation** 

  * Accommodation and travel costs are not included in the registration fee
  * Links to how to reserve accommodation
