# Overview

## Contents and learning goals

This course will focus on the **basics of microbiome data analysis
with R/Bioconductor**, a popular open source environment for
scientific data analysis. The participants get an overview of the
reproducible data analysis workflow in microbiome research, with a
focus on gut-brain axis. After the course you will know how to
approach new tasks in biomedical data analysis by utilizing available
documentation and R tools.

The teaching will follow open online documentation created by the
course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome
Analysis (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The openly licensed
teaching material will be available online during and after the
course, following national recommendations on open education.

The training material walks you through the standard steps of
biomedical data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis,
visualization, reproducible reporting, and best practices in open
science.  We will teach generic data analytical skills that are
applicable to common data analysis tasks encountered in modern omics
research. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the
student's learning speed.


## Schedule and organizers

The course will be organized in a live format <a href="https://www.ru.nl/radboudsummerschool/courses/2022/registration-longer-possible-brain-bacteria/">(website)</a>

**Venue** University of Radboud. July 11-15, 2022.

**Schedule**  A 
  detailed schedule is available at the course website:
  (https://www.ru.nl/radboudsummerschool/courses/2022/registration-longer-possible-brain-bacteria).


**Expected background** Some earlier experience with R or another
  programming language is recommended. However, this can be
  compensated by familiarizing with the course material in advance, if
  necessary. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the
  student's learning speed.
